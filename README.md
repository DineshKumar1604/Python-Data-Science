## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

This workshop covers the essential libraries and concepts in the Python data science stack:

* **Python Fundamentals**: Core data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), functions, error handling, and list comprehensions.
* **NumPy**: Creating and manipulating numerical arrays for scientific computing.
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis using Series and DataFrames, including handling missing data and file I/O.
* **Data Visualization**: Creating static plots and charts using **Matplotlib** and statistical visualizations with **Seaborn**.
* **Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**:
    * Supervised Learning fundamentals.
    * **Linear Regression** for predicting continuous values.
    * **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks.
    * **Decision Trees** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for more complex classification.
    * Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
